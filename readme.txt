This is a simple online banking system created by me.
And you can use this as your project template.
In this project I impletements basic online banking functionalities such
as transfer money, online bill payment, request a credit or debit card etc.

And also I implement bank manager page to this project.
In this project bank manager can add new employee to the bank, manager can see
the customer details and approve customer loan request and card request.
